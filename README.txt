Hi! Welcome to an unofficial Mellow Mushroom little text-base game. 
It will help players learn what ingredients make up the unique recipes on our [Makeline Only.]
That is to say: Whatever happens on Expo, stays on expo, not in this game lol.

New players should designate themselves as such, to run the introductory text.
After you've played, returning or "seasoned" players can elect to bypass the intro.

Most options requesting your input for the game will accept a variety of fun inputs,
so players can respond to these personably. ONLY THE INGREDIENTS require specific accurate typing.
There is a list displayed that offers players the corret spelling alongside a shortened code-type arrangement of letters.
Players can use the shorthand to speed up their gameplay and lessen how much they need to type. Capitals do NOT matter at all.

The game will record fastest times for each recipe. If the player would like to keep the recipe they've answered correctly to
engage in speed practice, they can elect not to remove it from the practice list and the game will tell them when they beat an old time.

After all recipes in the basic level have been completed successfully and removed from practice, the player can choose to continue to the next level.
The following iteration of play features a smaller amount of more unique recipes. Though less common, they are just as important to know.
They have been separtaed for simplicity of practice for the player to focus on fewer at once to learn and retain the recipes.

Good luck and have fun! Learning can be kinda cool.
